# matlab-app-for-passive-filter-design-and-analysis

## Objective
* To view the Bode Plot for the specified type of Passive Filter and cut-off frequency. 
* To view the value of Resistor, Inductor and Capacitor of the specified filter.
* To view the value of Quality Factor, Bandwidth and Error (%) of that filter.
* To view the Schematic Circuit diagram of the Filter.

## Installation Procedure:
Install with the “Passive Filter Design and Analysis.mlappinstall” file and locate the app in the MY APPS 
section of the app browser. Besides, the “Passive Filter Design and Analysis.mlapp” file is also provided 
to inspect the codes. It can be opened from the inside of MATLAB from OPEN menu. 
[N.B.: This app was designed in MATLAB 2020b. Problems may arise if the user’s MATLAB version is older 
than 2020b. Moreover, if the user wants to run the .mlapp file, then the folder named 
“image_folder_new” should be in the same directory of the .mlapp file.]
